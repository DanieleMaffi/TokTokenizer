# TokTokenizer
A tokenizer built initially by following [Andrej Karpathy's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=5403s) in a jupyter notebook.
Then brought to RUST to improve my rust writing skills and especially to make sure to internilize these basic yet gnarly tokenization concepts.
